      <p>
        JavaScript redirection is a technique used in web development to automatically
        send users from one webpage to another. This is commonly achieved using the
        <code>window.location</code> object, which allows developers to control the
        browser’s current URL. It is especially useful when a website has moved to a
        new address or when an updated version of a project is released.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the main advantages of JavaScript-based redirection is flexibility.
        Developers can apply conditions, delays, or user-based logic before redirecting.
        For example, a site may redirect users only after displaying a message or
        checking browser compatibility. This makes JavaScript redirects more dynamic
        than simple HTML meta refresh redirects.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it is important to provide fallback links for users who have JavaScript
        disabled. Including a visible link ensures accessibility and improves the user
        experience. When used correctly, JavaScript redirection is a powerful and
        user-friendly way to guide visitors to the correct content.
